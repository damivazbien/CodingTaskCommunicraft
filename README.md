An small coding challenge to get a better idea of my coding and problem-solving style




## Coding Task

Write a console application in C# that asks the user to input a sequence of brackets from the following: ()[]{}

This program should determine whether the input is balanced or not. Balanced input means that every opening bracket has a matching closing bracket at the same nested level.

Examples of balanced input:
()
(([]))
{[]{()}}

Examples of unbalanced input:
(()      (too many opening brackets)
())      (too many closing brackets)
([)]     (outer brackets closed before inner brackets have closed)
